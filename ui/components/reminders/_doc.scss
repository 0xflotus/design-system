/**
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Notifications should contain `role="alert"` on the container to signal to
 * assistive technology that they require the user’s immediate attention. Use a
 * span with `.slds-assistive-text` to let the user know what type of notification it is.
 *
 * @summary Reminders serve as a feedback & confirmation mechanism that comes in at the top right. The tile is a clickable region that will prompt an additional browser tab with that record loaded and dismiss the reminder tile notification. It is also dismissable by clicking the X icon.

 * #### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 * The reminder notification will consist of the following:
 * *Entity icon w/ background color
 * *Subject field from the reminder
 * *The time/date of when the event/task is occurring
 * *An‘X’ icon to dismiss the reminder

 *
 * @base
 * @name reminders
 * @selector .slds-reminder_container
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category experience
 * @type messaging
 * @role alert
