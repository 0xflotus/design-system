# Popovers Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## 2.7.0

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where long strings of text would overflow the popover boundary. Popover body, header, and footer now include `word-wrap: break-word`.
- Increased the contrast for focused links and buttons in our inversed popovers, Walkthrough and Feature.
