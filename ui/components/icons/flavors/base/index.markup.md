- [Utility](/resources/icons/#utility) and [doctype](/resources/icons/#doctype) icons have no background color.
- For [action](/resources/icons/#action) icons, add the `.{{cssPrefix}}icon_container--circle` class to the container (`.{{cssPrefix}}icon_container`), which changes the background shape to a circle.
- [Standard](/resources/icons/#standard) icons have a rounded square shape.
