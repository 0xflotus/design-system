Add this parent class `.{{cssPrefix}}x-small-buttons--horizontal` to the direct parent of a group of buttons to space them properly horizontally. If you want to change which breakpoint this behavior happens in, switch `x-small` for `small`, `medium`, or `large`. You can also add `max` before the sizing to switch it to go up to the size instead of at least that size (such as `.{{cssPrefix}}max-small-buttons--stacked`).
