/**
 * The Unified Color Picker allows for a fully accessible and 
 * configurable color selector interface.
 *
 * ### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 *
 * #### Required Dynamic Style Properties
 *
 * Since the Color Picker component is an interactive component used to set colors,
 * there are several places in the UI where dynamic style rules must be set by the
 * implementation code.
 *
 * - `.slds-color-picker__summary-button .slds-swatch`:
 *   A `background` property is needed on this element, which should be the current
 *   selected color value.
 *
 * - `.slds-color-picker__swatch .slds-swatch`:
 *   A `background` property is needed on these elements, which should be a selection
 *   of predefined colors.
 *
 * - `.slds-color-picker__custom-range`:
 *   A `background` property is needed on this element. As this element is meant 
 *   to represent the current selected hue's saturation and lightness matrix,
 *   hsl() syntax is the most appropriate here.
 *
 *   The hue should be set to the current selected hue (as indicated by the 
 *   `.slds-color-picker__hue-slider` range input), the saturation should always be 100%,
 *   and the lightness should be 50%.
 *
 *   _**Example:** hsl(220, 100%, 50%)_
 *
 *   A gradient overlay will provide the effect of the saturation and lightness matrix
 *   automatically.
 *
 * - `.slds-color-picker__range-indicator`:
 *   Declarations for `top` and `left` positioning are needed for this element, to properly
 *   place the Color Picker Range Indicator over the correct area of the custom range matrix.
 *
 *   For `left` positioning, the range is from 0-100%, and the axis represents color saturation.
 *   0% left is 0% saturation, and 100% left is 100% saturation.
 *
 *   For `top` positioning, the range is also from 0-100%, and the axis represents color lightness.
 *   The positioning is inversed, however, so 0% top is 100% lightness, while 100% top is 0% lightness.
 *
 * - `.slds-color-picker__hue-and-preview .slds-swatch`:
 *   A `background` property is needed on this element, which should be the current
 *   selected color value.
 *
 * #### Expected Keyboard Interactions
 *
 * - **Swatches:**
 *   The element `slds-color-picker__swatches` has the role of `listbox`, and
 *   keyboard interactions when its &lt;a&gt; children are focused should behave
 *   in a grid like fashion, and focus should move to the correct element.
 *
 * - **Color Picker Range Selector:**
 *   The Color Picker Range Selector (`.slds-color-picker__range-selector`) acts
 *   as an indicator for the current selected saturation and lightness values on the
 *   Color Picker Range. 
 *
 *   When focused, hitting an arrow key should move the selector
 *   1% in the given direction, up until boundaries are hit. If possible, holding down
 *   shift and striking an arrow key should move the indicator 10% in the given direction.
