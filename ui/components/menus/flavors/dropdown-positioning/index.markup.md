These are positioning helpers to assist in the location of the dropdown menu when invoked by a user. The default location of a dropdown menu is **top** and **center**, so when the dropdown is invoked, its location is at the center base of the target and expands top down. The support locations are top and bottom, `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown--bottom`, that can additional have a horizontal direction passed into it, `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown--left`.
