<p className="site-text-introduction">The {globals.displayName} grid, based on Flexbox, provides a flexible, mobile-first, device-agnostic scaffolding system. It includes helper classes that you can use to alter the look and behavior of your grid, such as alignment, order, flow, and padding helpers.</p>

<h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--label')}>Grid Wrapper</h2>
<p>To use the grid system, add the class <CodeClass className="grid"/> to an element, component, or page layout. Grid definitions are independent of one another, define attributes of the grid to a specific region in the app, <em>not</em> an all or nothing solution.</p>
<p>Adding the class <CodeClass className="wrap"/> causes the flow of your <CodeClass className="col"/> elements to wrap when they exceed 100% of their parentâ€™s width.</p>
<p>Easily change the flow direction of your grid by adding a modifier class to the <CodeClass className="grid"/> element. To stack your columns vertically instead of the default row behavior, use <CodeClass className="grid--vertical"/>. Additionally, you can reverse the left to right or top to bottom behavior by adding <CodeClass className="grid--reverse"/></p>
<p>If you want your application to take 100% of the width and height of the viewport and nest other grids within, use the top-level app helper class <CodeClass className="grid--frame"/>.</p>

<h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--label')}>Grid Items (Regions/Colums)</h2>
<p>By adding the class <CodeClass className="col"/> to the grid items, they will use an equal amount of space in the parent container. This automatic sizing allows you to achieve most desired outcomes. However, you can add manual <Link to="/components/utilities/sizing/">sizing classes</Link> to the columns if you need specific column widths.</p>
<p>Grid items have no gutters. They are simply equal divisions of their parent. If you want gutters, remove the class <CodeClass className="col"/> and replace with the class <CodeClass className="col--padded"/>, which adds a 0.75rem (12px) gutter to the left and right side of your column.</p>
<p>Using the manual sizing class helpers, you can specify a column span across the following grids &ndash;2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12. The grid supports up to 12 columns.</p>
<p>See <Link to="/components/utilities/sizing/">sizing utilities</Link> for more information and examples.</p>
