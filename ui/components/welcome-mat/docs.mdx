<div className="doc lead">
  A Welcome Mat provides a series of unordered items a user can click to learn about a thematic topic.
</div>

<Example title="Welcome Mat Base">
  <CodeView>
    <WelcomeMat />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

Welcome Mat tiles may trigger walkthroughs, modals, or take users to specific URLs.

The Welcome Mat consists of two sections, the informational left pane and the actionable right pane. 

The left pane should be used to educate users as to the theme of the content displayed in the right pane.

Icon choices, colors, and tile content can be customized to fit your experience.

## With Completed Steps

As users complete items in the list, the list updates to show as completed.

<Example title="Welcome Mat Completed Steps">
  <CodeView>
    <WelcomeMat showAsCompleted />
  </CodeView>
</Example>

To show a step as complete, the `slds-welcome-mat__tile_complete` class should be added to each completed `slds-welcome-mat__tile`.

## Trailhead Connected

The Trailhead Connected variant should only be used when users can achieve a badge in Trailhead for completing all steps in the current Welcome Mat. Only Trailhead connected mats may have the Trailhead font for the header.

<Example title="Welcome Mat Trailhead">
  <CodeView>
    <WelcomeMat trailhead />
  </CodeView>
</Example>
