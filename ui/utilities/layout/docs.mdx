## Magnet class utilities

The magnet utilities are used to vertically attach adjacent card like components.

The components/utilities that provide a card like look are the following:

* [Cards](/components/cards/)
* [Page Headers](/components/page-headers)
* [Box](/utilities/box)

If you need a card like component to appear flush to the card like component below, you the class  `slds-has-bottom-magnet`.

**Bottom Magnet**

<CodeView>
  <div className="slds-box slds-has-bottom-magnet">
    My Component
  </div>
</CodeView>

You'll notice the component's bottom side is flattened out.

**Top Magnet**

<CodeView>
  <div className="slds-box slds-has-top-magnet">
    My Component
  </div>
</CodeView>

You'll notice the component's top side is flattened out.

**Adjacently Attached**

Here is a simple example connecting two adjacent components.

<CodeView>
  <div className="slds-card slds-has-bottom-magnet">
    <div className="slds-p-around_medium">My First Component</div>
  </div>
  <div className="slds-card slds-has-top-magnet">
    <div className="slds-p-around_medium">My Second Component</div>
  </div>
</CodeView>
